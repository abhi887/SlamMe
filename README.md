# SlamMe

SlamMe is a webapp that takes the idea of writing slam books of our friends
and getting our friends to write our slambook and using some of our S.E
(technical preferred / or not) and take it online.

Basic idea behind this project is to encorage and help students (modern
college preferred) understand the idea and process behind the workings of the open
source projects and gain such experience.
